# Data Types Lab

## Timings

30 - 45 Minutes

## Summary

We have created a testing suite that will guide you in creating some variables for different purposes. In the lab.js file you will find instructions on which variables to create and why.

You can run the testing suite to see if you are correct by opening the tests.html file in your browser.

At the start all the tests will fail. It is your job to make them pass by creating the correct variables.

## Bonus Task

We haven't learned yet how to create JSON objects. Do some research and see if you can create one that makes the final tests pass.
